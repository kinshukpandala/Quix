# Quix

A Quick QR code generating interface which has more than URL generation 
I am planning to add more features such as 
  - QR code generation for UPI ids
  - Adding Logos in between the QR codes

Something that i am keen on developing is to make a tap QR code where in you dont need to scan it if its in a document or image u can just tap it and it will redirect u to the site 
not possible in an image but it is possible in a document in case ur genereating it for a location of some sorts
